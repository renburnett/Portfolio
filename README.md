## Personal Portfolio

This project was built with React and makes use of:
  - GitHub's GraphQL API
  - The React-pdf npm package (which was a bit tricky to implement because it doesn't play nicely with already-established `create-react-app` projects)
  - And the Semantic-React-Ui package for styling
This project is a chance to give a quick overview of past projects and a few of my personal interests.
