  ABOUT_ME: "Hi! In case you’re curious about my background, I worked at Boeing in Everett as a Composite Repair Technician for a little over 6 years before taking a voluntary layoff. I’d already been taking evening coding classes and was planning for a career transition-- my layoff became the perfect excuse to begin this new chapter of my life! In my free time I enjoy playing casual DnD with friends. I also can sometimes be spotted at the various barcades and board-game cafes throughout the city. I love traveling abroad especially to countries where I can practice my Spanish speaking skills. Love, honest communication and mutual respect y'all, thats what it's all about! Cheers!",
