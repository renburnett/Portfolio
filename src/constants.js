    "Hi there! My name is Ren, and I'm a Fullstack Web Developer. I am currently working for ",
  QUICK_BIO_B:
    " --a boutique tech company where we create/maintain websites, mobile applications and other technical solutions! During my time at Moby I've been lucky enough to bounce around between a bunch of different projects and I've added several features to one of our main/legacy projects, the Pagliacci website. As a quick example, I've added an 'order status visualization' widget that polls the backend and updates the UI to let the user know when the order is either 'recieved', 'en-route' or 'picked-up/delivered.' The Pagliacci website is written in Angular and we use observables for monitoring most state-change throughout the app. All in all, I'd consider myself a developer who enjoys problem solving and friendly collaboration on my path to a solution! (And for my final 'humble-brag' ðŸ˜‚) I was lucky enough to have one of the articles I'd written featured on ",
  ABOUT_ME:
    "Hey again! In case you're curious about my background, I worked at Boeing in Everett as a Composite Repair Technician for a little over 6 years before taking a voluntary layoff. I'd already been taking evening coding classes and was planning for a career transition-- my layoff became the perfect excuse to begin this new chapter of my life! Since then I've completed a year-long apprenticeship at Microsoft, worked are C4L Academy and contributed to a non-profit food delivery app to help those who are food insecure. I spent about a year working with C4L Academy on an ed-tech app. The app consisted of an admin+student online portal both written in React/Typescript and a shared Ruby on Rails backend. Using the aforementioned C4L Academy app, students could complete their High School education and earn a bonafide diploma! In my free time I enjoy playing casual DnD with friends, I also can sometimes be spotted at the various barcades and board-game cafes throughout the city. In the fall and wintertime you can catch me trying my best not to fall in my adult beginners hockey league! Okay.. last thing I swear; I love traveling abroad, especially to countries where I can practice my Spanish speaking skills. Love, open/honest communication and mutual respect y'all, thats what it's all about! Cheers!",
